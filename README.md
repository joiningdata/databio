# datab.io

A web portal that does automated identifier translation for bioinformatics.

## Use case

Ever find a dataset that looked amazing? Only problem is that it uses Gene IDs
that you aren't familiar with... With https://datab.io you can just upload the
data file, it will automatically determine what identifiers are present and
what they can be translated into. It'll then do the translation for you and
export a ZIP file containing everything you need to include in a publication to
ensure data provenance including methodological descriptions with citations,
versions and timestamps.
